# Next.js Personal Portfolio Website with Three.js, React Fiber & Framer Motion

## This is my personal portfolio website repository!

This project was built over the summer of 2023. I decided to make one along with a few of my buddies to initially make it easier to display my projects and contact information. I wanted to do something different and unique so I decided to use 3D models instead of static pictures. It was instinctively difficult because Next.js is a new technology and there aren't any tutorials anywhere but I got over this obstacle and completed my project. The website layout is inspired by Takuya Matsuyama.

- Create a custom website with Next.js using React.js.
- Framer motion was used mainly for transitioning and styling across components.
- Contains three.js and React Fiber for immersive and interactive 3D models.
- Deployed using Vercel's web hosting service integrated into Next.js.
- Responsive design using standard CSS in order to maintain a clear and concise layout across a variety of mobile platforms.
- Email.js is used for my contact form which makes it easier for me to receive any potential forms.
