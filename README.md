# Next.js Personal Portfolio Website with Three.js, React Fiber & Framer Motion

## This is my personal portfolio website repository!

This project was built over the summer of 2023. I decided to make one along with a few of my buddies to initially make it easier to display my projects and contact information.

- Create a custom website with Next.js using React.js.
- Framer motion was used mainly for transitioning and styling across components.
- Contains three.js and React Fiber for immersive and interactive 3D models.
- Deployed using Vercel's web hosting service integrated into Next.js.
